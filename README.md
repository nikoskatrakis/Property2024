# Property2024
Playing with a large database to derive property inflation statistics

This is a project using data from the UK land registry website with property data.
The objective is to produce a visual that shows property inflation rates across England and Wales. 
Properties with a single transaction were removed. Records with missing info (e.g. postcode that no longer exists) were removed. 
The code was written with assistance from Microsoft CoPilot and ChatGPT, however AI alone probably contributed about 80% of the code. 
The remainder was based on judgement and internet browsing.
The main package used to visualise the data was dash_leaflet. Notably, the centering facility is not working. 

Comments/suggestions welcome. Code produced on 11/12/2024.
